Description: Forensic applications of pedigree analysis, including likelihood ratios 
    for relationship testing, general relatedness inference, marker simulation, and 
    power analysis. General computation of exclusion powers is based on Egeland et 
    al. (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.05.001>. Several functions deal 
    specifically with family reunion cases, implementing and developing ideas from 
    Kling et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.08.006>. A novelty of 'forrel' 
    is the ability to model background inbreeding in forensic pedigree computations.
    This can have significant impact in applications, as exemplified in Vigeland 
    and Egeland (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigss.2019.10.175>. 'forrel' is part of the
    ped suite, a collection of packages for pedigree analysis. In particular, 
    'forrel' imports 'pedtools' for creating and manipulating pedigrees and markers,
    'pedprobr' for likelihood computations, and 'pedmut' for mutation modelling. 
    Pedigree data may be created from scratch, or loaded from text files. Data 
    import from the 'Familias' software (Egeland et al. (2000) 
    <doi:10.1016/S0379-0738(00)00147-X>) is supported.
